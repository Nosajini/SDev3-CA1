# Hi Patricia!
If you look in this branch and see this, then this is just the version of the site that I used while presenting, I made a branch so as to not break our deadline by updating main. This version has a lot of posts and accounts etc on it, the version in main branch only has a few test accounts etc to show off features more, so if you want to look at this one instead then feel free. This version is functionally the same as the main branch, although I did notice that the links for profiles embedded in comment author's names weren't in the template and I fixed that, feel free to assume they don't work, like in main!
