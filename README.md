# Hi Patricia!
If you look in this branch and see this, then this is just the version of the site that I used while presenting, I made a branch so as to not break our deadline by updating main. This version has a lot of posts and accounts etc on it to show off features more, the version in main branch only has a few test accounts/posts, so if you want to look at this one instead then feel free. This version is functionally the same as the main branch, although I did notice that the links for profiles embedded in comment author's names weren't in the template and I fixed that, feel free to assume they don't work, like in main!
